**LiorPatael/LiorPatael** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m currently working on my final project - "Cross view match" : we need to find the image that has been taken from UAV, in order to locate the location of the image.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Java, Python, JavaScript and HTML.
